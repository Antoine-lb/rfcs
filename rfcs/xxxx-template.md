# Detailed design

Describe the proposal in detail:

- Explaining the design so that someone who knows Strapi can understand and someone who works on it can implement the proposal. 
- Think about edge cases and include examples.

# Example

If the proposal requires changes to the current API or the creation of new ones, add a basic code example.

# Tradeoffs

What potential tradeoffs are involved with this proposal.

- Complexity
- Workload of implementation
- Can this be implemented outside of Strapi's core packages
- How does this proposal integrate with the current features being implemented
- Cost of migrating existing Strapi applications (is it a breaking change?)
- Does implementing this proposal mean reworking teaching resources (videos, tutorials, documentation)?

# Alternatives
